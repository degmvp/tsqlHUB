function abs() and sign() to create solution on select command in sql



Here is an example of how the ABS() and SIGN() functions can be used in a 
SELECT statement in T-SQL:



SELECT ABS(Column1) AS AbsValue,
       SIGN(Column1) AS SignValue
FROM Table1

This query will select the absolute value of Column1 as "AbsValue" and the
sign of Column1 as "SignValue" from Table1.

Alternatively, you can use these functions in a more complex query:

SELECT Column1, Column2, 
       ABS(Column1 - Column2) AS AbsDiff,
       SIGN(Column1 - Column2) AS SignDiff
FROM Table1
WHERE Column3 > 5

This query will select Column1, Column2, the absolute difference between Column1
 and Column2 as "AbsDiff", and the sign of the difference between Column1 and 
 Column2 as "SignDiff" from Table1 where Column3 is greater than 5.

You can also use these functions in a subquery, in a join statement and in a 
where clause, depending on your needs.
